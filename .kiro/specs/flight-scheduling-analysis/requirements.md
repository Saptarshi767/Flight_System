# Flight Scheduling Analysis System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an AI-powered flight scheduling analysis system to address the scheduling challenges at busy airports, particularly Mumbai and Delhi. The system will analyze flight data from multiple sources including FlightRadar24 and FlightAware to provide insights for optimizing flight schedules, reducing delays, and minimizing cascading effects on airport operations.

The solution will use open-source AI tools to process flight data and provide a natural language interface for querying processed information, helping controllers and operators make better scheduling decisions.

## Data Sources

The system will integrate with the following data sources:
1. **FlightRadar24**: Primary flight tracking data (https://www.flightradar24.com/)
2. **FlightAware**: Additional flight tracking and scheduling data (https://www.flightaware.com/)
3. **Mumbai Airport Data**: Specific scheduling data from FlightRadar24 (https://www.flightradar24.com/data/airports/bom)
4. **Delhi Airport Data**: Specific scheduling data from FlightRadar24 (https://www.flightradar24.com/data/airports/del)
5. **Sample Dataset**: Flight_Data.xlsx provided as reference data structure
6. **CSV Support**: System will support CSV format for easier data processing and analysis
